## Distributed Computing
When a group of computers working together to project as a single end system, it could be called as distributed system. These group of computers can have shared state, operate concurrently and fail independently without affecting the entire system. 

Distributed System enables horizontal scaling (i.e adding more computers to scale up). Vertical scaling is adding up more resources to the same server which has its resource limits and are potentially expensive. Other benefits are **Low Latency** (Since the cluster of machines can be geographically separated, requests can be served by the nearest ones which in turn reduces the Round-Trip Time) & **Fault Tolerance** (Even if one or more machines fail, the other machines in the cluster can keep the entire application up).
